110 Stories
===========

By Sasha Taylor
---------------

110 stories fell on top of me today,
I didn’t think the pain would ever go away.

When it finally did I realized where I was at,
Sitting at the gates of Heaven was exactly where I sat.

I tried to remember; at last it finally came,
Could this be a joke? Is this some sick twisted game?

A loud explosion from upstairs,
People panic and start to yell,

A man in a wheel chair starts to cry,
All I could think of was I was going to die.

Step after Step we ran from our fears,
I thought I would drown from the flow of our tears.

People started panicking and going insane,
I knew exactly what they were feeling for I felt their pain.

Nobody knew what happened,
All we knew was we didn’t have long,
To get out of the building before it was collapsed and gone.

All of a sudden I felt the ground start to shake,
None of this was real it was totally fake.

Then the floors started to fall,
I froze from panic, and couldn’t believe what I saw.

The smoke was so thick I couldn’t see,
Why in the world was this happening to me?

My life is now gone; on this earth I have no more time,
Even though I'm innocent I never committed the crime.

I don't understand how or why this happened. I don't understand how one group would have so much hate for us, how so many people could hate us that bad. I wonder how they had the hate to attempt to destroy us, wipe us out entirely. It scares me how there are people who would destroy us. Never forget, and never let it happen again. Never again.
