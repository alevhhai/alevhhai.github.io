My summer wasn't particularly interesting.

The first few days of my summer were just spent sitting around. Then, I went to Chillville at the Monon Community Center. I liked the camp previously, but the year before and this year were not fun in my opinion. I don't exactly know what, but something was missing.

I skipped the 7th week to take a game design course. I just made a few simple games in Game Maker and FPSCreator, nothing notable. I did enjoy it, but I didn't learn a lot.

The best part of the camp for me was the Indiana Beach trip on the 2nd-to-last day. I didn't go on any coasters, but I went on rides, and I had a great time.

I then went to Michigan for four days with my grandparents. The first day and second day I was working on fixing my Aunt's computer. The third day, I went to the Henry Ford Museum. It was an interesting museum, and I saw lots of things about American history. The fourth day we drove home first thing.

After that, nothing really happened.
